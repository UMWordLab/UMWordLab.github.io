# Research

Our research is focused on the linguistic representation of words and how these representations are comprehended in real-time processing, with a special focus on verb meaning and argument structure. We are very interestd in the ways that experimental work in semantics and psycholinguistics can inform linguistic theory and our understanding of linguistic representations. Our recent work is exploring ways to use NLP and pre-trained language models to investigate the relative contribution of grammatical properties versus frequency-based predictions in the processing of sentences.

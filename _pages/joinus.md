# Join Us

### Undergraduate Research Assistants
If you are interested in working with the lab as an undergraduate research assistant, [email me](mailto:lisalev@umich.edu) with the subect line "_WordLab RA Position_". Please explain briefly why you are interested in our lab, what your background is in linguistics and/or psychology, and whether you have any specific language or technical skills that might be relevant (for example, much of our work involves Python or R coding). There are a variety of lab-related tasks, so there are no specific pre-requisites, but this helps to determine whether you would be a good fit for projects in progress at the time of your application. 

Usually students start out in the lab through the UROP program or through volunteer or for-credit independent study work. Funded positions may be available, especially if you are eligible for work-study or if financial need would otherwise prevent you from having time to participate in research opportunities. 

### Honors thesis students at University of Michigan 
If you are interested in working with the lab for your honors thesis, [email me](mailto:lisalev@umich.edu) with a brief description of what you are hoping to work on. It's OK if you are generally interested in this area of research and don't yet have a specific project idea, especially if you are still in your junior year. 

### Specific openings

We are currently looking for a lab member who is a native or highly fluent speaker of Spanish (any variety) who is interested in working on stimuli design.
